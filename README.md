This folder contains Matlab code for reproducing figures in the paper titled
"Correlated states in balanced neuronal networks"
by Cody Baker, Christopher Ebsch, Ilan Lampl, and Robert Rosenbaum

Please cite this paper in any publications for which you use this code or any derivatives thereof.

The files are named to indicate which figure panels they reproduce. 

Files named Fig*sim.m contain the simulation for the figure panels listed in *
Files named Fig*sim.mat contain the data generated by the corresponding .m file.
Files without the sim ending contain code to produce figures from the data.

For example, if you want to reproduce figure panel 2C, you can just run the script Fig2CD4D.m 
which will automatically load the simulation data already stored in Fig2CD4Dsim.m to
reproduce figure panels 2C, 2D, and 4D.

You would only need to run the simulation script Fig2CD4Dsim.m if you want to re-run
the simulation to re-generate the data in Fig2CD4Dsim.mat. 

Be warned that some of the simulation scripts take 10+ hours to run and use over 8GB of data.

The only exception to the file naming convention is Fig3A.m, which does not have an associated simulation because it plots experimental data. The data are in files hd.mat, dd.mat, and hh.mat.
